# scribe
Scribe is a Python script that transcribes audio files and exports the transcriptions as PDF documents. It supports MP3, M4A, and MP4 file formats as input and generates a PDF file with the transcription text formatted on an A4 size page. The script also utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a title for the transcription.
